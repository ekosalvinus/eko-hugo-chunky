### Overview
CUPK Mobile application is an application that runs on android devices. CUPK Mobile is a financial application used in the Pancur Kasih Credit Union Savings and Loan Cooperative (CUPK). The CUPK Mobile application was first released on May 28, 2016. Some of the functions of CUPK Mobile are to save deposits, pay loan bills, electricity bills, water, telephone, internet, buy credit & data packages, transfers and many other payments.

### The Problem
There are two main problems that I found on their old application, including:
* There are additional features so that there are more menus and need to categorize features
* Some user flows from some features still confuse users

### User and Audience
* CUPK members who have not used CUPK Mobile
* CUPK members who are already using old version of CUPK Mobile

### Role & Responsibility
The CUPK Mobile Redesign Team consists of several elements from each section in CUPK such as Legal, Research, Public Relations, HR, IT and Finance sections (Team size is about 15 people).I play a role in the UI and UX design of the application and prepare the design for application promotion purposes

### Job step
##### Some of the stages of work that I did include:
* Conduct simple research on constraints to gain insight into user pain points
* Create user personas
* Create application UI design (Wireframe, High Fidelity)
* Create and test UI into prototype
* Doing UX copywriting
* Iteration

##### Software I use
Design: Figma, Adobe Illustrator

The following image is an application screen display created using Figma.

### Outcome and Result
The app was released on February 18, 2021 and reached over 1,000 users in less than a month since its release.
The new application looks fresher while still prioritizing ease of use.

### Is the goal achieved?
There are many lessons that can be learned from designing CUPK Mobile, including learning to understand the flow of a mobile application, especially financial applications, applying UI and UX designs into real projects.
